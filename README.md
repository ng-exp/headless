# Angular Headless UI Components

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ngexp/headless-ui.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/ngexp/headless-ui)

Very early ongoing project.

The idea:
Create components that is very easy to use, but not styled at all. Developed with focus on using tailwind for styling but not limited
to it in any way.

More documentation will be added as the project continues.
